# AngryMonkey
A lightweight documentation generator originally created for documenting Gaea.

It is similar to [DocFx](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/) but more lightweight and flexible. It focuses less on API documentation and more on meaty articles.

It generates simple HTML, and relies on Javascript for search, TOC, and more. The output is very portable and can run anywhere, including GitHub pages.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/QuadSpinner/AngryMonkey/wiki) for basic instructions. A proper website generated with the Monkey is coming soon once we finalize the features.

The new version (2.0) is almost complete. Hang in there.
