# AngryMonkey
A lightweight documentation generator originally created for documenting Gaea. It is similar to [DocFx](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/) but more lightweight and flexible. It focuses less on API documentation and more on meaty articles.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/QuadSpinner/AngryMonkey/wiki) for basic instructions.

This is an early version and very unpolished. Be prepared to get your hands dirty.
